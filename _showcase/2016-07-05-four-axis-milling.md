Forum member LAIR82 has retrofitted this Cincinnati Milacron with 4 axes.  In
this video, you can see a sample of the rotary axis, and a glimpse of the
"gscreen" gui.  In another video in the [forum
thread](https://forum.linuxcnc.org/forum/show-your-stuff/29904-1984-cincinnati-milacron-vmc-with-4th-axis)
you can see the toolchanger in action.  It is controlled with the Coursel
Component "and a pretty heft chunk of ladder logic."
