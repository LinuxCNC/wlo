# LinuxCNC Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and leaders pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level or type of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being kind and courteous to others
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Collaborating with other community members
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances
* The use of inappropriate images, including in a community member's avatar
* The use of inappropriate language, including in a community member's nickname
* Any spamming, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Promoting or spreading disinformation, lies, or conspiracy theories against
  a person, group, organisation, project, or community
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

The goal of the standards and moderation guidelines outlined here is to build
and maintain a respectful community. We ask that you donâ€™t just aim to be
"technically unimpeachable", but rather try to be your best self.

We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration and
supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for
other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply
providing the correct answer.

## Our Responsibilities

Project leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject messages, comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any community member for other behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct and the enforcement policies listed above apply to all
LinuxCNC Community venues. This includes but is not limited to any community
spaces (both public and private), the LinuxCNC mailing lists, the LinuxCNC
forum, the LinuxCNC IRC channels, and LinuxCNC GitHub repositories. Examples of
LinuxCNC Community spaces include but are not limited to meet-ups, the LinuxCNC
Discord, LinuxCNC Matrix channels, or interaction at a conference.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. As a community
member, you are representing our community, and are expected to behave
accordingly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant version 1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html),
the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html),
and the [Adafruit Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Community_Code_of_Conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

For other projects adopting the LinuxCNC Community Code of
Conduct, please contact the maintainers of those projects for enforcement.
If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider
explicitly mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your
own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.
