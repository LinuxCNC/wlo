At least once per year, the board will send an email to each person listed as an admin, asking them if they wish to continue serving in that role. (This is to weed out inactive admins.) After receiving responses to those emails (or if no response is received in a reasonable period) the board will vote on each admin. A simple majority (3 of 5 votes in favor) will be sufficient to retain an existing admin. Four votes in favor will be needed to add a new admin. The board will ensure that there are always at least three active admins.</p></blockquote>
