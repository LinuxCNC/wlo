## LinuxCNC 2.8 Downloads

LinuxCNC requires a realtime kernel if it is to be used to control machinery. 
There are two versions of the package, "linuxcnc-uspace" and "linuxcnc"

"linuxcnc-uspace" is compatible with the preempt-rt realtime kernel, which
is close to standard Linux. This version runs in userspace like most
other applications and will run with any preempt-rt kernel. 

"linuxcnc-uspace" will also run on a standard Linux kernel for use as a
simulator, but it should not be used to control hardware. 

"linuxcnc" (without a suffix) is a package which runs in kernel space 
and needs a specific RTAI kernel, which we also supply. (ie the exact
kernel version installed must match that which the package was built
against.) This has been the default mode for linuxcnc for decades,
but has become increasingly difficult to maintain. This mode is currently
less stable than the uspace option (but only when unloading, it appears stable
once realtime is running) but can give much better latency on some machines.
Note that it is only parallel-port controlled systems using software-based 
stepping and/or encoder counting that need particularly good latency 
performance. 

It is also possible to run linuxcnc-uspace, in user-space, with the RTAI
kernel if the helper package "linuxcnc-uspace-rtai" is installed. This is
something of a half-way house between the other two versions. A similar
package can be built for the Xenomai realtime kernel, but is not available
as a pre-built package. 

The links below point to the latest released images. Older releases can still be
found [here](https://www.linuxcnc.org/iso/)

* LinuxCNC 2.8.4 [Debian 10 Buster PREEMPT-RT ISO](https://www.linuxcnc.org/iso/linuxcnc-2.8.4-buster.iso)

The Debian 10 Buster ISO will install a full Debian system with the required
realtime kernel and the linuxcnc-uspace application. It uses a PREEMPT-RT
patched kernel  which is close to mainstream Linux but does not, in some
cases, give quite such good realtime performance as the previous RTAI
kernel. It is very often more than good enough. It should probably be
the first version tried even if using a parallel port.
This is compatible with all Mesa and Pico interface boards.

* LinuxCNC 2.8.4 Debian 10 Buster RTAI

The more adventurous can install the Buster ISO and then install the
experimental RTAI kernel as described in 
[2.8 documents](http://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.8/html/getting-started/getting-linuxcnc.html#cha:Installing-RTAI)
The kernel-mode RTAI installation can not be used with Mesa Ethernet-interfaced cards. 


* LinuxCNC 2.8.1 [Raspberry Pi OS based on Debian 10 Buster](https://www.linuxcnc.org/iso/linuxcnc-2.8.1-pi4.zip)

Raspberry Pi 4 Uspace compatible with Mesa Ethernet and SPI interface boards.


Regular development builds (several times a day) can be found here. 
* [LinuxCNC Buildbot](http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/)

More information on downloading and installing is in the
[LinuxCNC Documents](http://linuxcnc.org/docs/stable/html/getting-started/getting-linuxcnc.html)


## LinuxCNC Packages

LinuxCNC debian packages aka .deb files can be installed on a system with dpkg
from the command line or with GDebi as a graphical install method. You will need
to have a compatible realtime kernel to control machinery.
