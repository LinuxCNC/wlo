  Here you'll find information <a href="about/">about the

  help</a>.</p>

  <p>Community maintained <a
  href="http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl">wiki</a> with lots
  of information and examples about configuration and using LinuxCNC.<br
  /><br />LinuxCNC is a software system for computer control of machines
  such as milling machines, lathes, plasma cutters, cutting machines,
  robots, hexapods, etc.</p>

  <p>LinuxCNC is Free software released under the terms of the<a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html"> GNU
  GPLv2 (General Public License version 2)</a>.<br /><br />LinuxCNC
  is a descendent of the original NIST Enhanced Machine Controller
  software, which is in the Public Domain.<br />LinuxCNC has many
  exciting new features and brings a lot of new functionality (a
  flexible and powerful Hardware Abstraction Layer that allows you
  to adapt it to many kinds of machinery, a software PLC controller,
  easier-than-ever installation, a new trajectory planner, and more.)<br
  /><br />LinuxCNC is precompiled with Debian Wheezy (or, previously,
  Ubuntu LTS) for ease of installation and longevity.</p>

  <p>Note: Do Not upgrade the Linux operating system from the installed
  version as it will prevent LinuxCNC from working as a specific kernel
  is required.</p>
