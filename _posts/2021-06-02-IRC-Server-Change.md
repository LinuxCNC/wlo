title: 'LinuxCNC IRC is moving to Libera.chat'
---
Following the example of many prominent projects including
[Centos](https://blog.centos.org/2021/05/centos-irc-channels-moving-to-irc-libera-chat/),
[Fedora](https://fedoramagazine.org/irc-announcement-fedora-moving-to-libera-chat/),
[FreeBSD](https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/Official-FreeBSD-IRC-channels-now-on-Libera-Chat),
[Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/news/2021/05/23/Moving-to-Libera.html),
[Wikipedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Migrating_to_Libera_Chat), and
[Ubuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/05/ubuntu-irc-moves-to-libera-chat),
the LinuxCNC project is shifting its primary real-time chat presence to the new
[Libera.chat](https://libera.chat) IRC service.  See the [community
page](https://www.linuxcnc.org/community/) for information on how to connect,
including directly in your web browser.

Most IRC clients support connecting to multiple networks at the same time, so
if you still want to participate on channels on Freenode (or have direct
messages with people on Freenode) this option is available to you as well.

We thank Freenode's largely volunteer staff for providing a space to organize
and discuss LinuxCNC for many years, and we thank the Libera.chat staff
for providing a new space for the years to come.

Because of [reported retaliation for mentioning the libera.chat alternative
on freenode](https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/26/freenode_irc_takeover/),
the channel topics on the Freenode channels will not be updated to directly
refer to libera.chat by name.
