### LinuxCNC 2.9.8 has been released.

This is a minor update release, mainly of interest to those using the
hal_gpio HAL driver (mainly Pi users)

Changelog:

  * backport #3516 to fix #3679
  * Only initialize python if not yet initialized.
  * hal_gpio: Adapt to use libgpiod3 or libgpiod2 according to what is installed
  * Merge pull request #3671 from smoe/docs_image_handling
  * core-components.adoc remove duplicate descriptions
  * Merge pull request #3642 from LinuxCNC/2.9_#2460
  * Update LinuxCNC RTAI Install instructions
  * Merge pull request #3555 from smoe/lintian_warnings
  * Merge pull request #3588 from f355/2.9
  * [ci] publish releases with artifacts
  * debian: Addressed lintian warnings
  * axis.py: restore mdi queuing provision       #2460

The main driver for the release was the change in API for the gpiod
driver. This resulted in the hal_gpio driver not being built under
Trixie.

As of this release the default Debian version for the ISO for both PC
and Pi has been updated to Trixie.
The LinuxCNC repositories have been updated for Buster, Bullseye,
Bookworm, Trixie and Sid.

Note that released debs are also now available on the LinuxCNC GitHub
under "Releases": www.github.com/https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc

As always, thanks to all the developers who make this possible, and for this
release especially:

Bertho Stultiens
Dewey Garrett
Konstantin Tcepliaev
Robert Schöftner
