### LinuxCNC 2.9.2 has been released.

This is a bugfix release, with the
most obvious change being that run-from-line in the Axis interface
should now be working again.

Packages have been prepared for:

Buster - uspace - amd64 (PC) armhf (Pi) arm64 (Pi with 64-bit kernels)  
Buster - RTAI - amd64  
Bullseye - uspace - ams64 (only)  
Bookworm - uspace - amd64, arm64  
Bookworm - RTAI - amd64  

For existing users of 2.9.1 on the above platforms this should be
offered as an automatic update.

If anyone badly needs Bullseye debs for RTAI or arm64 / armhf then let
me know. (all but the amd64 uspace builds have to be manually created)
