LinuxCNC 2.7.11 has been released.  This is just a quick bugfix release,
nothing earth-shattering.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.

  * doc changes for the transition to github
  * carousel: fix a bug with tool number of zero
  * axis/gremlin: a better way to avoid leaking files
  * test that the Python interpreter prints the right errors

Enjoy!
