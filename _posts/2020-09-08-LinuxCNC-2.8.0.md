LinuxCNC 2.8.0 has been released.

The full changelog:

* Finally merge "Joints Axes". Joints and cartesian axes are no longer
  treated as the same thing, making control of robots and non-trivial
  kinematics significantly tidier.
* Add a script to automatically update to the new INI file layout and
  new HAL pin names.
* Multispindle: LinuxCNC now supports up to 9 spindles.
* Tandem axes handled properly, including auto-squaring.
* Reverse-Run: Negative adaptive-feed will now run the G-code path in
  reverse.
* External Offsets, axes may now be moved from HAL as well as G-code.
* increase max tools from 55 to 1000.
* Many Trajector Planner improvements.

* M98/M99 subprograms: - Support Fanuc-style subroutines
* Add G74/G84 floating tap cycles
* Enable remap of M62-M68
* Implement G52 offsets
* G33.1 Rigid Tapping speedup, with optional faster return move

* pentakins kinematics.
* trivkins now allows arbitrary mapping of axes to joints.
* dh-parameters.txt doc (with graphics for rv-6sl)
* corexy sims: demonstrate two methods
* kins: add scorbot-kins
* rotarydelta config with simulation
* Rotary delta kinematics

* QTvcp: New QT-based VCP framework
* QTdragon, QTlathe, QTtouchy, QTscreen - new GUIs based on QTVP
