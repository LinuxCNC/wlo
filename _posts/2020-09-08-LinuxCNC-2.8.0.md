LinuxCNC 2.8.0 released. This is the first major release of LinuxCNC's new
Joint Axes technology. Joints and cartesian axes are no longer treated as the
same thing, making control of robots and non-trivial kinematics significantly
tidier.

WIP, it will take a day or two to finish this release page up.
