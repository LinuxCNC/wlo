This sidebar will feature selected posts from our forumâ€™s "Show Your Stuff"
category and other sources.

To suggest a machine or project for the showcase, create an issue on our
[website's github repository][github].  Submissions should consist of at least
one photo or video, a short explanation, and include a link to the forum or a
personal blog with more information.

The showcase is not for promoting commercial products that use or include
LinuxCNC, it is for promoting things that the LinuxCNC software enables
our users to do.
