[1] I don't have a Pi running armhf at the moment, though it's just a case of setting up an SD card then building the package. 
If you need it, then let me know. 

[2] If anyone badly needs Bullseye debs for RTAI or arm64 / armhf then let
me know. (all but the amd64 uspace builds have to be manually created)
