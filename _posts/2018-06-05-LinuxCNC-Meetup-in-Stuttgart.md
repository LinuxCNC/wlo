There will be a meeting of LinuxCNC developers, users, and enthusiasts
in Stuttgart, Germany, during the weekend from Friday July 20 to Sunday
July 22.

This will be a pretty informal meeting, there is no registration,
no entrance fee, no badges, no speakers, and no set agenda.  It is a
chance for people interested in LinuxCNC to meet each other, show off
their projects, and talk about issues, fears, hopes, and dreams.
