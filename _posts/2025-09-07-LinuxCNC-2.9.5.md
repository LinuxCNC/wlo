### LinuxCNC 2.9.5 has been released.

This is mainly a bugfix release, but includes a new modbus driver for
the Mesa UART (update/replacement for mesa_modbus with more
flexibility and configurability)

Packages for 2.9-uspace for amd64 (PC) for Debian Buster, Bullseye,
Bookworm and Trixie and for arm64 (Raspberry Pi 4/5) for Buster and
Bookworm have been added to the linuxcnc repository.
If you installed from one of our live images or Pi SD-card images then
the update should be available immediately.

If you  installed into a normally-installed Debian from the Debian
repositories then hopefully the new version can be queued up for the
next point release. If you can't wait then it is possible to add the
LinuxCNC repositories to the apt sources. One way to do this and
install the security keys is via the shell script here:
https://linuxcnc.org/docs/stable/html/getting-started/getting-linuxcnc.html#_installing_on_debian_bookworm_with_preempt_rt_kernel

At the moment the live-image installer and SD card images will install
2.9.4 but update should be trivial (and possibly automatic)

RTAI is still supported, but in the short term building from source is
likely to be the most expedient way to get 2.9.5 on that platform.

 * Backport new hm2_modbus driver to 2.9 branch.
 * Fix probe contact bounce triggering error during decel phase
