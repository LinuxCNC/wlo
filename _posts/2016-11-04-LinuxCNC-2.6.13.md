LinuxCNC 2.6.13 has been released.

This release fixes a couple of bugs in the G-code interpreter, increases
the number of supported stepgens to 16, and has numerous minor bugfixes
all over.  All 2.6 users are encouraged to upgrade.

This will be the final bugfix release in the 2.6 series.  If you
want future updates and bugfixes you'll have to [switch to
2.7](http://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.7/html/getting-started/updating-linuxcnc.html).


A heart-felt "Thank You" to everyone helping out in our forums and mailing
lists, to the people testing the software and reporting bugs, and to
the people fixing bugs and improving the documentation.  People like
you make open source software work.

Committers in this release are:

* Chris Radek
* Dewey Garrett
* James Waples (first commit, a libmodbus fix!)
* Jeff Epler
* John Morris
* John Thornton
* Jon Elson
* Moses McKnight
* Norbert Schechner
* Sebastian Kuzminsky
