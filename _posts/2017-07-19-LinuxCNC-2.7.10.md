LinuxCNC 2.7.10 is out.  This one's a relatively boring stable release.
A few minor bugs have been fixed, but the real highlights are:

  * full support for Debian Stretch (uspace realtime with RT-Preempt)
  * support for Mesa 7i93 Hostmot2 Ethernet board
  * support for Huanyang GT-series VFDs


Thanks to the folks who contributed patches and fixes for this release:

  * Andy Pugh
  * Jeff Epler
  * John Thornton
  * Norbert Schechner
  * Sebastian Kuzminsky


And of course, as always, thanks to everyone helping
out in the [forums](https://forum.linuxcnc.org/), [mailing
list](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/emc-users), and
on [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23linuxcnc),

[issues](https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/issues) on github.
