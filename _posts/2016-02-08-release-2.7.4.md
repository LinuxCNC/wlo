LinuxCNC 2.7.4 has been released.

This release fixes bugs all over: in hm2 sserial, GUIs, xhc-hb04, hy-vfd,
stepconf & pncconf, and in the docs.  2.7.4 adds support for RTAI 5.0,
though we have no debian packages yet, sorry.  It also adds a component
to help drive some kinds of gantry machines (named "gantry.comp").

All 2.7 users are encouraged to upgrade.

mailing lists, and IRC, to the people who brought this round of bugs
