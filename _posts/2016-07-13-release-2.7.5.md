LinuxCNC 2.7.5 has been released.

This release includes a fairly large change to the controller, intended
to make Abort (eg, hitting Escape while running a program in Axis)
work more correctly.  This change also affects controller startup,
including the processing of [RS274NGC]STARTUP_GCODE.  Please be
on the lookout for any surprises in these areas, and [let us
know](http://linuxcnc.org/community/) if you notice anything amiss.

This release also includes many other bug fixes, especially in PncConf
and Stepconf, the Gmoccapy GUI, GladeVCP, the 'carousel' toolchanger
component, and more.

All 2.7 users are encouraged to upgrade.
