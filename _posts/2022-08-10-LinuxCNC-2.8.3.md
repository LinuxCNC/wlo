LinuxCNC 2.8.3 has been released.

This is, again, mainly a bugfix release, but includes a new GUI
("Craftsman")built on Glade.

All users are encouraged to update. 

A new ISO is likely to follow in time, but this should be an automatic
update for most installed 2.8 systems. 

Note that at the moment there is no kernel-space RTAI (2.8.3-rt) package
for Buster.
It is likely that a 2.8-rt package will be made available in a few days,
but it is possible to run linuxcnc-uspace on an RTAI kernel if the
additional package linuxcnc-uspace-rtai is installed.
