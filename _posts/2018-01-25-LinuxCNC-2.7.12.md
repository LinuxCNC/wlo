LinuxCNC 2.7.12 is out.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.
The highlights of this release are:

* Major improvements in the limit3 component, thanks to John Morris.
* Several important bugfixes all over.
* Add Chinese translations.


Our project had three developers make their first commits in this release.
Welcome to LinuxCNC, and thank you for helping us making it better!

* Rudy du Preez

And as always, thanks to all the old hands in the forum, the git repo,
and elsewhere.  You make our glorious enterprise possible.
