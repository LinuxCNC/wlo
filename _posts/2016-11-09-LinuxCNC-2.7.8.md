LinuxCNC 2.7.8 has been released.  This is a stable maintenance/bugfix
release, all 2.7 users are encouraged to upgrade.  And if you're still
using LinuxCNC 2.6, there's never been a better time to upgrade to 2.7!

This release fixes a couple of bugs related to MDI, cutter compensation,
G95 (feed per revolution mode), and in the GUIs, including a long-standing
buglet with the backplot/preview.  There are also lots of improvements
to the documentation.

I want to thank our awesome community for the friendly, helpful
collaboration that makes this project what it is.  Committers in this
release are:

* Chris Radek
* Dewey Garrett
* Jeff Epler
* John Morris
* John Thornton
* Moses McKnight
* Norbert Schechner
* Sebastian Kuzminsky
* Thoren Seufl (new committer! lots of docs fixes!)
