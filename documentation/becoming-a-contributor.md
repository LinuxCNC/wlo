<h1>Becoming an EMC Contributor</h1><p>Because it is Free Software, anyone can  modify the EMC software and distribute those changes to others.&nbsp; But for  these improvements to be enjoyed by the greatest number of users, they must  be incorporated into the official version of EMC which is distributed by  linuxcnc.org.<br />This document describes how to contribute your improvements  to linuxcnc.org.<br /><br />(This document uses the term Contributor instead of  Developer, because Contributions can take many forms including documentation,  artwork and localization (translation), while the word Developer generally means someone who writes code)</p><h2>Step 1. Participate in the  EMC community</h2><p>First, make yourself a member of the community.&nbsp; This  generally means participating on the IRC channels (#Emc on freenode.net)  and/or mailing lists (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=6744">http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=6744</a>). </p><h2>Step 2. Know and articulate how you&#39;d like to help</h2><p>How do you  hope to improve EMC?&nbsp; If you have a new feature in mind, talk about it and  get a feel for how others think it will fit with the EMC project.&nbsp; If you  want to translate or document, find out whether someone else is working on  the same thing.&nbsp; If you want to fix nontrivial bugs, discuss your approach  with others who are familiar with the source code.</p><h2>Step 3. Understand  the development tools</h2><p>Here are a few things that you should know how to  do:</p><ul><li>Obtain and update the source code with git</li><li>Produce and apply  patches (&quot;diffs&quot;) with git</li><li>Build the software and test your  changes</li></ul>For more detailed instructions look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?Git" target="_blank">wiki git page</a>.<br /><h2>Step 4. Share your work</h2><p>After making your changes,  produce patches.&nbsp; Use e-mail, IRC, or the web to share them with others.&nbsp;  Work with a Contributor who has git commit access to refine the patch.&nbsp; If  your changes fit with our vision of emc, a Contributor with git commit access  will add the changes to the official version.&nbsp; Be prepared to accept  criticism of your patch; remember that it&#39;s not personal  criticism.<br /><br />For certain things which can stand alone (such as HAL  components), we have dedicated wiki pages (<a href="http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?ContributedComponents">http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?ContributedComponents</a>)</p><h2>Step 5. Ask for git commit access</h2><p>Having git commit access means that you  can directly add your changes without prior review by another  Contributor.<br /><br />After you have several contributions under your belt, talk  with a member of the <a href="content/view/12/10/lang,en/">EMC Board of Directors</a>  about getting commit access.&nbsp; The  Board will generally quickly make a decision whether to grant commit access.</p>
