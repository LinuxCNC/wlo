<p>In less than two weeks a couple of motivated guys from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hacklab.to/" target="_blank">hacklab</a>&nbsp;in Toronto went from a completely non-functional machine containing motors and a laser, to a complete laser engraving/cutting system installed and working fairly well. There are still some minor tweaks they are working on, but overall the results are quite encouraging. It&#39;s another fine example of a retrofit using emc2 (the Enhanced Machine Controller v2).</p><p>Even more, they went on an produced a very nice article about the whole struggle. The article can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.andrewkilpatrick.org/blog/?page_id=914" target="_blank">Andrew Kilpatrick&#39;s blog</a>.</p>
